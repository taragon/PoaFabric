            <h2>Why is Upcycling Important?</h2>
            <p>Upcycling helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, conserving valuable space and reducing pollution. It minimizes the need for new raw materials, preserving natural resources and lowering environmental impact. Upcycling also cuts down on energy consumption during production processes. By upcycling materials, we give them a new life and reduce our carbon footprint. Ultimately, upcycling is a powerful step toward a more sustainable, responsible future.
              <br>Upcycling plays a role in our employment sector, few requirments are needed for employment making it suitable to combat the rising rate of unemployment in our country.
              Through upcycling we are able to combat and mitigate climate change and take climate action.
